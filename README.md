# filloabot-rs
A multipurpose (including music) Discord bot. This is a full rewrite using Rust of the original [FilloaBot](https://github.com/FilloaBot/filloabot/). Some features that were considered useless haven't been ported.
So, right now it simply plays music and answers to messages with appropriate memes, the latter is meant to be configurable by the guild administrators using a web but I'm still working on it.

## üîß Deploy it

### üê≥ Docker (Recommended)

As commented before this needs access to an API to fetch the message memes (a.k.a. references) and thus it needs a dumb server serving them until I finish the final one.
It's all included in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```bash
mkdir filloabot-rs
cd filloabot-rs

wget https://github.com/FilloaBot/filloabot-rs/raw/master/docker-compose.yml
wget https://github.com/FilloaBot/dumb-api/raw/main/references.json

vim references.json # Edit as you wish
docker-compose up -d
```
